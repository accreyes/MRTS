Mixed Reality Training System
Developed using Unity 3D 2018.3.7f1 with Vuforia 8.0.10 plug-in

This project uses AR targets overlaid with virtual target to allow natural interaction in a mixed reality environment. Four motherboard parts were used in this project as a proof of concept. The physical targets used were illustration board cutouts of the motherboard parts layered with images of stones. The virtual motherboard part is then mapped to the physical object and projected through a see-through device.
